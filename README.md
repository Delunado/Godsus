### What's "Godsus" about?

Godsus is a *local-multiplayer fighting* game. In Godsus, each player play as the spirit of ancients God, Soleo or Lunea, who have faced each other for millennia. Soleo wants to destroy Lunea, and vice versa.  

Each player, as the spirit form of the God, can posses the little but destructive creatures that populate the world, and use their powers against its enemies and other creatures. Each creature is unique and have its own combination of two powers!

IMPORTANT: The game can be only played with two controllers. There is no way to play with the keyboard. Sorry!

We also used some SFX from [Freesound] (https://freesound.org/).

We designed a simple game with lots of little mechanics, and that wasn't the best idea, because we couldn't polish this mechanics correctly. But it was a big programming and design challenge and I'm proud of the result.
